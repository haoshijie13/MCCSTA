### The codes employed in the 3-D multimodal atlas project of the marmoset brain.
### The cell types and connectivity of primate brains remain unclear. We created a 3D multimodal atlas of the marmoset brain by combining single-cell spatial transcriptomes, MRI, and retrograde labeling.
This multimodal atlas offers new understanding of primate cortical organization and evolution.
