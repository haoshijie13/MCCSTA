*The cell types and connectivity of primate brains remain unclear. We created a 3-D multimodal atlas of the marmoset brain by combining single-cell spatial transcriptomes, MRI, and retrograde labeling.*
*This multimodal atlas offers new understanding of primate cortical organization and evolution.*
